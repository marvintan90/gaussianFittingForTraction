% Upgrade of Andrew Diamond's quiverc2wcmap to generate a quiver plot
% with arrows colored according to vector magnitude. 
% Functional differences from quiverc2wcmap:
%   1) Allows user to specify colormap boundaries using 'bound': changes 
%      colorbar axes AND corresponding vector coloring
%      (much more useful for intercomparison of datasets)
%   2) Improved fidelity to magnitude colors in large datasets 
%      (at a cost of increased computation time...)
%      Uses some improvements from DS's vfield_color
%   3) Small clarifications added
% Example:
%             x = rand(1,50).*100;
%             y = rand(1,50).*100;
%             u = rand(1,50) .* 10;
%             v = rand(1,50) .* 10;
%             scale = 0;
%             figure; quiverwcolorbar(x',y',u',v',scale); %compare to:
%             figure; quiverwcolorbar(x',y',u',v',scale,'bounds',[0 10]);

% This is based off of Tobias Höffken which was based off of Bertrand Dano
% keeping with their main intent to show a color w/r to magnitude quiver plot
% while maintaining a large amount of quiver API backwards compatability.
% Functional differences from quiverc2:
%   1) This works under 6.5.1
%   2) It handles NaNs
%   3) It draws a colormap that is w/r to the quiver magnitudes (hard coded to
%   20 segments of the colormap as per quiverc2 - seems fine for a quiver).
%   4) Various bug fixes (I think)
% In order to do this I needed some small hacks on 6.5.1's quiver to take a
% color triplet.  I have included as part of this file in a subfunction below.

% Comments from quiverc2
% changed Tobias Höffken 3-14-05
% totally downstripped version of the former
% split input field into n segments and do a quiver qhich each of them 
 
% Modified version of Quiver to plots velocity vectors as arrows 
% with components (u,v) at the points (x,y) using the current colormap

% changed T. Höffken 14.03.05, for high data resolution
% using fixed color "spacing" of 20

%QUIVERC Quiver color plot.
%   QUIVERC(X,Y,U,V) plots velocity vectors as arrows with components (u,v)
%   at the points (x,y).  The matrices X,Y,U,V must all be the same size
%   and contain corresponding position and velocity components (X and Y
%   can also be vectors to specify a uniform grid).  QUIVER automatically
%   scales the arrows to fit within the grid.
%
%   QUIVERC(U,V) plots velocity vectors at equally spaced points in
%   the x-y plane.
%
%   QUIVERC(U,V,S) or QUIVER(X,Y,U,V,S) automatically scales the 
%   arrows to fit within the grid and then stretches them by S.  Use
%   S=0 to plot the arrows without the automatic scaling.
%
%   QUIVERC(...,LINESPEC) uses the plot linestyle specified for
%   the velocity vectors.  Any marker in LINESPEC is drawn at the base
%   instead of an arrow on the tip.  Use a marker of '.' to specify
%   no marker at all.  See PLOT for other possibilities.
%
%   QUIVERC(...,'filled') fills any markers specified.
%
%   H = QUIVERC(...) returns a vector of line handles.
%
%   Example:
%      [x,y] = meshgrid(-2:.2:2,-1:.15:1);
%      z = x .* exp(-x.^2 - y.^2); [px,py] = gradient(z,.2,.15);
%      contour(x,y,z), hold on
%      quiverc(x,y,px,py), hold off, axis image

%-------------Generate colorbar-------------
% Includes a clever way to generate (and subsequently hide) an image that 
% is required for colorbar without running out of memory for large datasets.  
%
% Condensed comments from quiverc2wcmap:
% In 6.5.1 if you ever want a colorbar tick marks to reflect real data ranges
% (versus just the indices of a colormap) then there apparently has to be an
% image somewhere in the figure.  Of course, I don't want an image but I figured
% I just make it invisible and then draw the quiver plot over it.
% Unfortunately, it seems that colorbar uses caxis to retrive the data range in
% the image and for invisible images it always seems to be 0 UNLESS you
% explictly reset the caxis.  
% This will work but then the axis will be oversized to accomodate the image
% because images have their first and last vitual "pixels" CENTERED around the
% implicit or explict xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax (as per imagesc documentation) but the
% start and end of each of these "pixels" is +/- half a unit where the unit
% corresponds to subdividing the limits by the number of pixels (-1).  Given
% that formula and given my invisible 2x2 image for which it is desired to
% diplay in an axis that ISN'T oversized (i.e. min(x), max(x), min(y),max(y)) it
% is possible to solve for the limits (i.e. an artifically reduced limit) 
% that need to be specified for imagesc to make its final oversized axis to be the 
% non oversized axis that we really want.
% xa,xb,ya,yb compenstates for the axis extention given by imagesc to make
% pixels centered at the limit extents (etc.).  Note, this "easy"
% formula would only work for 2x2 pixel images.
